# Pokemon-SwiftUI-Flutter

Updated for iOS 13 release and Learn Swift LA Meetup *Developing with SwiftUI at ISBX*.

This directory contains the final code for the Pokemon SwiftUI example for the Flock of Swifts June 22, 2019 meetup.  I also included a version of the same app written for Flutter so you can compare the architectures.
